## Code of Conduct

We expect everyone participating in this project to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Below are the main points, but we encourage you to read the full Code of Conduct.

- Treat everyone with respect.
- Avoid making assumptions about other people's identities and experiences.
- Keep criticism constructive and respectful.
- Report any incidents of harassment or inappropriate behavior to the project maintainers.

## Coding Guidelines

### Clean Architecture Rules

Our project follows the principles of Clean Architecture. This means that we separate concerns, make the project independent of any frameworks, and make it testable and independent of the UI.

In addition, our domain layer should not depend on the adapter layer. Please ensure that any contributions you make maintain this separation and adhere to these principles.

### Type-Safe Programming

We aim for a type-safe programming style, so please avoid using `any` or `as`. Instead, use type guards or other means to determine types.

## Writing Tests

Testing is a crucial part of our development process. We expect all code contributions to be accompanied by corresponding tests. This helps us maintain the quality of the project and catch any potential issues early.

## How to Submit Changes

Once you've identified a bug or an enhancement you'd like to work on, follow these steps to make and submit your changes:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes, ensuring you follow our coding conventions and style guide.
4. Write tests for your changes.
5. Submit a pull request.

Please note that we may take a while to respond, but we appreciate your patience. We aim to make the contribution process as transparent as possible and will keep you updated every step of the way.

## Recognition

We value all our contributors and would like to recognize the work you do. Here are some of the ways we recognize our contributors:

- Listing top contributors in the project README.
- Shoutouts in our community meetings.
- Special badges for consistent contributors.

## Getting Help
